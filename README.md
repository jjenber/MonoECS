# MonoECS
An Entity Component System for making games using [MonoGame]("http://www.monogame.net/").

## What is an Entity Component System?
This framework builds on a lot of the information found here [http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/]("http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/").

## Version 0.1
This is very much a work in progress and right now the bare minimum for an ECS framework. It will continue to be updated though. The current version includes a Core project containing all code for the ECS. It also includes a minimal Test project to show an example of how the framework can be used.  

## Plans as of now:
- Better component matchers with more variations.
- Reactive systems.
- XML documentation.
- Wiki guide.
